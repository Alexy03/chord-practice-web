🎸 Guitar Chord Auto-Play App
Welcome to the Guitar Chord Auto-Play App! This web application helps guitarists practice chords by randomly generating chord diagrams and playing the corresponding audio, allowing for hands-free practice with a timer-based auto-play feature.

📋 Features
Auto-Play Mode: Automatically generates a random chord and plays the audio every 5 seconds to help you practice with rhythm.
Practice Mode: Manually generate random chords for focused practice.
Chord Display: Shows chord diagrams and plays chord sounds for visual and auditory learning.
Responsive Design: Works on any device, including desktops and mobile phones.

🚀 How It Works
Start Auto-Play: Click the "Start Auto-Play" button to begin automatic chord generation. A new chord will appear every 5 seconds.
Stop Auto-Play: Click the "Stop" button to pause the auto-play feature.
Practice Mode: Click the "Practice Mode" button to generate a single random chord at your own pace.
